# Fashion-MNIST Multi-Model Classifier

A machine learning project that classifies the Fashion-MNIST dataset using multiple models, including CNNs with advanced techniques like data augmentation, model regularization, and hyperparameter tuning.

## Overview

The Fashion-MNIST Multi-Model Classifier project aims to classify the Fashion-MNIST dataset, which consists of images of various fashion items, using various convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This project explores the use of multiple deep learning techniques to improve model performance and interpretability.

## More About the Project

This project involves training and comparing multiple models on the Fashion-MNIST dataset. The models utilize techniques such as:

- Data Augmentation (e.g., CutMix, MixUp)
- Regularization (Dropout, L2 Regularization)
- Hyperparameter tuning using Keras Tuner
- Advanced model comparison with confusion matrices and classification reports

The Fashion-MNIST dataset contains images of the following classes:

- T-shirt/top
- Trouser
- Pullover
- Dress
- Coat
- Sandal
- Shirt
- Sneaker
- Bag
- Ankle boot

Each model is evaluated based on accuracy and other performance metrics to determine the best-performing model.
